# Personal-Assistant-MEGA

### She's MEGA, thanks to advanced python and packages. She can respond to predefined requests such as playing a song from any streaming platform, displaying the current time and date, browsing wikipedia and google for answer choices, opening stackoverflow, telling a joke, sending an email with the subject and content, singing a song, making an announcement, and, most importantly, having a general conversation with the user.

#### Her code isn't public because she's currently a work-in-progress.
